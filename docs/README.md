# A simulation of the game of Backgammon
This will be a fully functional, playable, complete simulation of a game of backgammon, written entirely from scratch in Java.
# About
This is my latest project started in September 2023. I hope to make a fully functioning backgammon game that plays in the terminal. I will then create a GUI to make it more user-friendly. Afterwards, I hope to create an AI for backgammon.
